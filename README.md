# Hey, I'm Alankrit 👋

I build AI-native products and ship fast. Currently running **LeadFlow Lab**, a Revenue Infrastructure Studio helping B2B companies build outbound systems that actually convert.

I don't wait for perfect. I vibe-code with Claude + Cursor, iterate in public, and treat momentum as the metric.

## What I'm Building

**Signal** - A macOS Gmail automation app. Classify emails, trigger rules, and kill inbox noise without leaving your flow. Launching on the App Store.

**william.ai** - Anti-slop AI ghostwriting. Only accepts Personal Experience or Pattern Recognition inputs. No generic takes, no filler. Built for founders who have something real to say.

**Outreach Engine** - Next.js + Apify-powered system that finds and qualifies YC companies for targeted outreach at scale.

## What I'm About

- AI-native development: I build with AI the way engineers use compilers
- Revenue-first products: everything I ship has a clear path to money
- Shipping over polishing: a live product beats a perfect prototype every time

## Let's Talk

I'm looking for a **remote product role at a US-based YC startup** starting April 2026.

If you're building something ambitious and need someone who ships, reach out.
